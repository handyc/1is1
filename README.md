# 1is1

1is1 experimental programming language

1=1

The primary distinguishing feature of this language is in its use of the = sign
to indicate both assignment and equality.

In 1is1, variables are created in pairs through the use of equality expressions.

Variables can be simple or complex, and are evaluated to various degrees depending

on requirements for a variable at any given time.

- whitespace does not count
  
- each equation/equality is simultaneously a variable assignment and a truth claim

- each equality is associated with two dynamic variables stored as unicode strings

- each string is evaluated lazily at various resolutions depending on its need within an application


# examples

x=5

x = 5

5=x

5 = x

x + y = 3

x + y = a * 3

f(x) = 1

f(x) = g(y)
